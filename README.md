# Linear Regression Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of both `Single` and `Multiple` Linear Regression from scratch using Python. The project includes the following key steps:
- Implementing the linear regression algorithm.
- Plotting the best fit line on a graph.
- Evaluating the regression model using key metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R² Score, and Adjusted R² Score.
